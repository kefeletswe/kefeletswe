TESTING

I have tested that this website works in different browsers such as safari, chrone and Firefox.

I confirmed that the header, navigation, about, team, facilities and login are readable and easy to understand.

I have confirmed that some of the features in the website are responsive and work on all screen sizes. The home bar, and about us section are not responsive to different screen sizes.

I confirm that not all the features of the form are working.






PROBLEMS
 

Kindergarten name located on the top-right corner was underlined. I solved this by adding the <a> element before the div instead of inside the heading_area div.

The background image on the header could not fill in the whole page. Tis was because the CSS width was in px instead of % percentage
could not zoom out image

 Team member images did not look the way code is meant to be.
 I had to edit pictures into oval shape before adding them into image folder and also had to remove an extra dash (-)sign on the css  file.
